# The Fruiter

**The Fruiter** is a fast-paced mobile game developed in Kotlin for Android. The objective is to tap falling fruits to score points while avoiding bombs that immediately end the game. The game includes an inactivity timer that resets when a fruit is collected, and difficulty scales over time by increasing the speed and number of falling objects.

## Overview

This project was created to demonstrate core gameplay mechanics using Android development tools. It features coroutine-driven animations, adaptive difficulty, and reactive UI design. The code is structured to maintain clarity, scalability, and responsiveness.

## Gameplay Mechanics

- Tap normal fruits to earn points.
- Avoid tapping bombs, which end the game instantly.
- An inactivity timer ends the game if the player doesn't interact for too long.
- Difficulty increases progressively with faster falling speeds and more objects per cycle.
